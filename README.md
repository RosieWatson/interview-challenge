# Extra notes

- I didn't get to add all the tests I would like, I added some component/user interaction tests but not as many to cover the logic
- If I had more time I would have broken down the file structure more to have made it easier to read and also increase the read-ability of some of the functions and components
- If this wasn't a short task and a real project I would have looked at using redux and storing the items in local storage rather than using component state that will disappear on refresh
- I would also have added in error states to handle the situation where the api doesn't respond
- I would also have created an endpoint that returns the different dietary requirements so that it is not a hardcoded list
